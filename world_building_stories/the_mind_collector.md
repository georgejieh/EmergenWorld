#### Day 1 - 17th of Frostmoon, Third Age 827

I've been assigned to investigate a series of unusual incidents in the Lower Quarter. Four individuals, with no connection to one another, found wandering in a state of confusion, speaking incomprehensibly about "colors that sing" and "angles that breathe." All recovered within two days with no memory of their episodes.

Magistrate Coldwell believes it to be a new strain of mind-altering herb from the Southern Isles. Perhaps. But their symptoms remind me of something from my Academy days - the disorientation that follows certain perception exercises. I never advanced far enough at Silverpeak to understand the theory behind such exercises, but I witnessed their effects on fellow initiates often enough.

The victims: a clockmaker, a university mathematician, a fishmonger, and the daughter of merchant house Bavrish. No shared habits or circles that I can identify.

The only commonality: all had visited Corvus Square within a day of their afflictions.

---

#### Day 3 - 19th of Frostmoon

Spent the day observing Corvus Square. Nothing unusual beyond the typical market bustle. As dusk approached, I noticed a blind fortune teller's booth I hadn't seen during my morning circuit. 

The sign read "Madame Morvai - See Beyond the Veil." The phrasing caught my attention - a common enough promise for a fortune teller, but it echoed terminology I'd encountered at Silverpeak. The Academy was always concerned with perception beyond ordinary sight.

Patrons entered for readings lasting precisely twelve minutes each. Every patron emerged touching their temples, as though nursing minor headaches. This pattern reminded me of my early training exercises - the particular discomfort that follows the first attempts to extend perception beyond normal boundaries.

I considered having my fortune read but something about the booth's angles disturbed me. The corners seemed... wrong somehow. My eyes refused to focus on them properly. I've experienced similar visual distortions only once before - in a demonstration during my brief tenure at Silverpeak, when a lecturer showed us how certain geometric configurations affect perception.

I decided against approaching the tent directly. Better to observe first.

---

#### Day 5 - 21st of Frostmoon

A new victim emerged - Guildmaster Harrick's apprentice, Loran. Found this morning tracing elaborate geometric patterns on his workshop floor with crushed gemstone powder. The patterns were unlike anything I've seen in standard geometry, yet oddly familiar.

When I arrived, he was lucid enough to speak, though his eyes wouldn't focus properly. "The spaces between thoughts are wider than we believe," he said. "She showed me how to stretch my mind into them."

I asked who "she" was. "The blind woman who sees everything," he replied before convulsing. The city physician administered a sedative.

I noted symbols drawn on Loran's inner wrist that matched no language I recognize from my secular education. By evening, the markings had vanished completely from his skin.

The symbols disturbed me in their familiarity. I'd seen similar markings in restricted texts at Silverpeak - glimpsed briefly during my unauthorized exploration of the archives, the transgression that led to my departure. I couldn't decipher them then and can't now, but I recognize their significance.

I sent a sealed message to Master Ferren at Silverpeak - my former instructor who defended me during the dismissal proceedings twelve years ago. The note contained only the symbols I'd seen and my city address. If these markings mean what I suspect, the Academy should be informed. Whatever is happening in Veilport goes beyond criminal activity.

---

#### Day 6 - 22nd of Frostmoon

I sent my assistant Teller to have his fortune read. He returned disoriented, complaining that the inside of the tent "didn't match the outside." When pressed, he couldn't explain further, only that "the angles bent wrong."

Most concerning: he reported that Madame Morvai never physically touched him but somehow extracted childhood memories he's certain he never shared. She asked specific questions about his dreams and whether he ever "saw things others couldn't." He admitted to occasional prophetic dreams, thinking it harmless fortune teller banter.

I found the same symbols on his wrist that I'd seen on Loran. I've documented them in the attached sketch. They fade even as I draw them.

Teller's experience confirms my suspicions. The questions about perception and dreams mirror Academy recruitment protocols - identifying individuals with particular perceptual sensitivities. But the Academy would never conduct such evaluations publicly, and certainly not without proper safeguards. Something deeply irregular is happening.

This evening, a response arrived from Master Ferren - faster than should be possible through normal means. The sealed letter contained only three words: "Withdraw immediately. Containment inbound."

The urgency of the message and the word "containment" speak volumes. The Academy takes perception manipulation very seriously - it was one of the few principles thoroughly explained even to lower circle initiates. To interfere with another's perception without proper preparation is considered extremely dangerous. That the Academy would deploy containment specialists suggests whatever is happening has escalated beyond public hazard to active threat.

---

#### Day 7 - 23rd of Frostmoon

Master Devrin the clockmaker - the first victim - was found dead this morning. His body was contorted in ways that should be physically impossible. The city physician found no cause beyond "complete system failure." No poison, no wounds.

While examining his workshop, I discovered hidden notes tucked beneath his workbench. Complex calculations and diagrams far beyond a clockmaker's knowledge. References to "elevation potential" and "sphere thresholds" appeared throughout. I've included copies with this entry.

Most disturbing was a margin note: "She says I'm close to breaking through. The headaches are worth it."

Much of the material exceeds my understanding, but certain terms stand out from my Academy training. "Sphere thresholds" relates to consciousness classification - the orderly progression of perception that Silverpeak insisted could not be rushed without dangerous consequences. 

During my time at the Academy, I witnessed a student who attempted forced progression through unsanctioned exercises. The resulting seizures and bleeding were mild compared to Devrin's fate. These notes suggest someone is pushing untrained civilians through perceptual barriers they are not prepared to cross.

I've been in this profession for twelve years since leaving the Academy. I've seen every manner of depravity and criminality the city offers. Yet something about this case chills me more deeply than murder or corruption ever has. The manipulation of perception itself strikes at something fundamental about reality.

---

#### Day 8 - 24th of Frostmoon

A visitor came to my office today - a merchant named Corvus who claimed to have information about the "afflicted ones." Something about him immediately put me on edge. His movements were too precise, his eyes never blinking when they should.

He spoke of the victims as "fortunate pioneers" and suggested their experiences were "gifts rather than afflictions." When I pressed him on his interest in the case, he smiled strangely and said, "Let's just say I'm an investor in human potential."

As he left, he placed a card on my desk. "If you're curious about what they experienced, I could arrange a demonstration." The card bore only an address - the old observatory on Blackridge Hill.

After he departed, I examined the chair where he'd sat. The wood was warped slightly, as if exposed to intense heat, though I'd felt nothing unusual during our conversation.

The significance of an observatory is not lost on me. At Silverpeak, we were taught that certain perceptual exercises were best conducted under specific celestial alignments. An abandoned observatory would provide both the necessary astronomical tools and the privacy such experiments would require.

I'm being followed now. Not by common footpads or hired muscle - I know those signs well enough. These shadows are more subtle. Some move with the disciplined precision I recognize from my Academy days - likely containment specialists sent by Master Ferren. Others move differently - with a fluidity that disturbs the eye. These, I suspect, are Corvus's people.

---

#### Day 9 - 25th of Frostmoon

Returned to Corvus Square to find Madame Morvai's tent gone. Vendors claimed no memory of a blind fortune teller, despite my having witnessed their interactions with her just days before.

The collective forgetting is a clear sign of memory manipulation - a rare but documented capability among certain Academy specialists. That such techniques would be deployed in a public setting is deeply troubling. Memory manipulation requires precise control to avoid permanent damage.

Later, a runner delivered a letter to my office. No seal, no signature. It read simply: "Your perception is sharper than most. This quality has been noted. Old affiliations need not define future potential."

The message clearly refers to my Academy past and suggests whoever sent it believes I could progress further than Silverpeak permitted. The implication makes my skin crawl. I left the Academy not just because of my disciplinary issues, but because I'd seen enough to recognize the dangers of rushing advancement.

I've set a trap for my observers. Left false notes indicating I'll investigate the abandoned brewery tonight. I'll observe who takes the bait and perhaps learn which faction is most actively monitoring me.

---

#### Day 10 - 26th of Frostmoon

The trap worked. Three separate parties are monitoring my investigation.

First, Academy containment specialists - two figures who examined my office with methodical precision and left no trace except a faint trace of purification incense, standard Academy protocol when dealing with perception-affecting materials.

Second, city guardsmen in plain clothes - Magistrate Coldwell clearly doesn't trust me to handle this alone.

Third and most concerning - a hooded figure who entered after the others departed. Unlike the methodical Academy observers, this one moved with unsettling fluidity. They examined my notes but took nothing. Instead, they left something - a small silver disk with strange markings.

I recognized the disk immediately as an orientation compass - a tool I'd seen but never used during my Academy days. Reserved for advanced initiates, it supposedly responds to patterns of consciousness rather than magnetic fields.

When I returned to examine it, the disk was warm to the touch. On impulse, I placed it on my investigation map of the city. It rolled unnaturally, settling over the old observatory on Blackridge Hill - the same location mentioned on Corvus's card.

More victims have appeared. Seven cases reported yesterday alone. The Magistrate is facing pressure to declare a public health emergency.

I face a choice. Master Ferren warned me to withdraw, but containment specialists seem to be observing rather than acting. Meanwhile, people are dying. The Academy's caution has always been its weakness - preferring observation and analysis while practical threats demand immediate response.

I've decided to investigate the observatory myself, tonight.

---

#### Day 11 - 27th of Frostmoon

I visited Blackridge Observatory before dawn. Ostensibly abandoned years ago when the University built their new astronomical facilities, I found evidence of recent occupation. Disturbed dust patterns. Fresh candle wax. And journals.

The journals contain detailed records of experiments on "consciousness elevation" and "forced sphere progression." Diagrams of the mind as a series of ascending chambers. Notes on "candidates" with specific mental qualities.

Much of the content exceeds my limited Academy knowledge, but the methodology is clear enough. These experiments combine orthodox Academy techniques with something far more aggressive - attempting to force perception expansion in hours rather than the years of careful progression Silverpeak insisted upon.

Most entries discuss failures - subjects whose minds "rejected elevation" or who suffered "perception collapse." Clinical descriptions of what appear to be excruciating deaths.

A single success is noted: "Subject 27 achieved temporary threshold elevation. Maintained 6th-state cognition for 73 seconds before neural regress. Survived with memory suppression. Parameters noted for future attempts."

I was making copies of the most relevant pages when I heard footsteps approach. I concealed myself behind an astronomical cabinet, employing basic presence-masking techniques from my Academy training.

A woman entered - not blind at all, despite her role as Madame Morvai. She wore scholar's robes bearing no insignia I recognized, though the cut and material suggested advanced standing in some academic hierarchy. She retrieved something from a hidden compartment, then left.

I waited, then continued my search. In the hidden compartment, I found a letter bearing an official-looking seal - a stylized eye within a triangle. The symbol was instantly recognizable - the mark of the Academy's Containment Division. The letter mentioned "unauthorized experimentation" and "containment protocols," confirming my suspicion that whoever is conducting these experiments is doing so against Academy sanction.

I'm copying the journals tonight and will deliver my findings to both the Magistrate and Master Ferren. Whether the Academy approves or not, local authorities need to be informed of the danger.

---

#### Day 12 - 28th of Frostmoon

I was preparing my report when a visitor arrived at my office - a severe-looking woman who introduced herself as Magistrate Laris from the "Office of Public Safety." I've worked with every magistrate in this city for over a decade and have never heard of such an office.

She knew details of my investigation that appear nowhere in official records. When I questioned her authority, she demonstrated knowledge of my own past that unsettled me deeply - including my childhood incident at the lake that I've never shared with anyone, not even during Academy screening.

"Your investigation has interfered with a matter of greater jurisdiction," she informed me. "You will cease immediately. Your service is acknowledged but no longer required."

I refused. My duty is to the city and its people.

She sighed, then did something I'd only seen once before - in a demonstration by a high-circle lecturer at the Academy. She extended her hand, and I perceived, just for a moment, the flow of energy around her fingers, condensing into patterns too complex to follow.

"Inspector Morrow, there are forces at work beyond your comprehension. Your perception is impressive for your sphere, but limited nonetheless." She placed a folder on my desk. "Read this, then make your decision."

The folder contained profiles of each victim, including information impossible to obtain through normal investigation. More disturbingly, it contained a profile of me. Notes on my "perception sensitivity" and "elevation potential." A full accounting of my Academy record, including the real reason for my withdrawal - not the family emergency I've claimed publicly, but my unauthorized attempt to access restricted circle manuscripts after becoming obsessed with theories of perception I'd glimpsed in texts not meant for my eyes.

When I looked up, she was gone. The folder remained.

---

#### Day 14 - 30th of Frostmoon

I cannot sleep. The profiles haunt me. Each victim possessed similar traits - unusual perceptual sensitivity, occasional prophetic dreams, brief moments of inexplicable knowing. Traits I've experienced throughout my life but dismissed as investigator's intuition. Traits that got me recruited to Silverpeak in the first place, before my impatience and curiosity led to my dismissal.

The researcher - this "Mind Collector" as I've come to think of them - is attempting what the Academy deems impossible: accelerating consciousness evolution artificially. Creating a shortcut to higher perception without the decades of preparation normally required.

I returned to the observatory tonight, bringing no one into my confidence. The building was empty, all evidence of occupation gone. I recognized the thoroughness of Academy cleanup protocols - they've been here since my last visit.

On my way back to the city, I noticed unusual activity near the Ancient Library. Lights in the sealed west wing. Movement on the roof. I changed course to investigate.

As I approached, a figure stepped from the shadows - Magistrate Laris.

"You were warned, Inspector."

"People are dying," I replied.

"A regrettable necessity in preventing greater harm."

Before I could respond, the night sky above the library... changed. I lack words to properly describe it. Colors that shouldn't exist. Geometries that hurt to observe. For a moment, I perceived the library not as a building but as something alive and aware.

"What you're seeing is the work of one we call the Mind Collector," Laris said. "A researcher who believes consciousness evolution can be artificially accelerated. Their experiments have drawn attention we cannot afford."

"A rogue Academy member," I said, the pieces finally connecting in my mind.

She glanced at me sharply. "You understand more than you should, given your limited exposure."

"Three years at Silverpeak. I listened more than I was supposed to."

A team of robed figures emerged from carriages bearing the same eye-in-triangle symbol. They entered the library without acknowledging us.

"Who exactly is this Mind Collector?" I demanded.

"A former Archmagister who rejected our methods as too cautious. They believe perception can be forced rather than nurtured. The victims were merely test subjects - disposable steps toward their goal of artificially elevating consciousness en masse."

"And you're going to stop them? How?"

"We maintain the boundaries between what is and what should not yet be known," she answered. "The Mind Collector breached those boundaries. Now we contain the damage."

What happened next defies rational documentation. The library seemed to fold inward upon itself. A silent flash of light emanated from within. A wave of... something... rippled outward.

When it passed through me, I momentarily perceived reality in a way that exceeded anything I'd experienced at the Academy. Layers upon layers of existence. Currents of energy flowing through all things. The limitations of my own mind laid bare. I saw what I might have become had I completed my Academy training. I saw what lay beyond even that.

For a moment, I understood why the Academy insisted on gradual progression. The mind requires preparation to withstand such perception. Without it, the experience is overwhelming - beautiful and terrible beyond comprehension.

Then darkness took me.

#### Day 16 - 2nd of Frosthaw

I woke in my own bed two days later. My case notes were neatly stacked on my desk, including this journal. The final entries are not in my handwriting, though they match it convincingly.

The Mind Collector case has been officially closed. The victims have all recovered, with no memory of their experiences. Master Devrin's death has been attributed to heart failure. The Magistrate thanked me for resolving the matter, though he couldn't quite specify what I had discovered.

I find I cannot clearly recall certain details myself. The harder I try to remember, the more elusive the memories become. Memory alteration techniques - an Academy specialty I'd heard whispered about but never experienced until now.

But I notice things now. Shimmers in the air when light strikes at certain angles. Whispered conversations that stop when I approach. The way some buildings seem briefly different when viewed from the corner of my eye. My brief exposure seems to have left permanent traces - nothing dramatic enough to qualify as elevation, but enough to remind me of what exists beyond ordinary sight.

Most telling: the Ancient Library's west wing has been demolished due to "structural concerns." No one questions this despite the wing being visibly intact just weeks ago.

Today, a package was delivered to my office. Inside was a silver disk identical to the one I found before, and a note:

"Some minds are ready. Yours nearly was. Our work continues elsewhere."

I should report this to Master Ferren. I should pursue this.

I will do neither. Some mysteries, I now understand, are beyond the tools of conventional investigation. Some truths are protected not to maintain ignorance, but to preserve sanity.

I return now to ordinary crimes committed by ordinary people for ordinary reasons. Yet I find little comfort in these familiar waters. For I have glimpsed, however briefly, the vast ocean beyond, and know myself to be swimming in a mere tide pool of reality.
