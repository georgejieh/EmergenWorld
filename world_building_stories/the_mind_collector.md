## PART I: THE IMPOSSIBLE AFFLICTION
### Chapter 1: The Peculiar Case of Master Deverell

The autumn air carried the sharp scent of wood smoke and impending frost as Investigator Rivian Ashe made his way through the cobbled streets of Northaven. The ancient city had shed its summer vibrancy for more somber hues—browns and ambers that matched the fallen leaves crunching beneath his boots. He pulled his woolen coat tighter around his lean frame, more from habit than necessity. The cold had never bothered him as it did others.

Rivian had been summoned by an urgent message from Magistrate Kallus, delivered by a breathless courier just as he'd been preparing to review case notes on a series of warehouse thefts. The message itself was unusually terse: *Clockmaker Deverell. 7 Tarnish Street. Come immediately.*

Magistrate Kallus was not given to exaggeration or unnecessary urgency. If he deemed something worthy of Rivian's immediate attention, then it undoubtedly was.

As he turned onto Tarnish Street, the neat rows of shops and workshops that characterized this artisan district came into view. Unlike the crowded merchant quarter or the sprawling labyrinth of the lower city, this area maintained an air of ordered precision—each building standing equidistant from its neighbors, each sign hanging at the same height. The clockmakers' district seemed to embody the meticulous nature of its inhabitants.

Number 7 was marked by a modest sign bearing a silver timepiece. "Deverell's Chronometrics" read the elegant script beneath it. Despite the early hour, a small crowd had gathered at the entrance, their hushed voices creating a conspiratorial buzz.

"Make way for the Investigator," commanded a city guard whose weathered face Rivian recognized but couldn't name. The crowd parted reluctantly, curiosity evident in their eyes as they took in Rivian's distinctive gray coat—the unofficial uniform of the Magistrate's special investigators.

"Investigator Ashe," nodded the guard, touching his cap in a casual salute. "The Magistrate's inside, second floor."

"Has anyone left the premises since you arrived?" Rivian asked, his eyes already scanning the building's facade, noting the partially open window on the second floor, the fresh mud on the doorstep despite the dry weather of the past three days.

"No, sir. Locked it down tight as the Magistrate ordered. Only the apprentice, the household servant, and the physician inside. And the clockmaker himself, of course." 

Rivian nodded and stepped through the doorway into a showroom that spoke of modest success. Glass-topped cases displayed pocket watches and desk chronometers of fine quality, though lacking the ornate embellishments that might be found in the shops catering to nobility. A spiral staircase of dark wood dominated the rear of the room, and from above came the sound of voices.

As he climbed the stairs, the voices grew clearer.

"—absolutely unprecedented in my thirty years of practice," came the clipped tones of what Rivian presumed to be the physician.

"But what *caused* it?" The Magistrate's familiar baritone replied.

Rivian reached the top of the stairs and took in the scene with a single sweeping glance. The workshop was meticulously organized—tools hanging on a wall grid, each in its designated place; worktables with projects in various stages of completion; a large window providing ample natural light. Four people occupied the space: Magistrate Kallus, a gray-haired man with a physician's case, a thin young man who kept wringing his hands, and a middle-aged woman whose plain dress marked her as domestic staff.

And then there was Master Deverell.

The clockmaker sat in a straight-backed chair in the center of the room, his posture unnaturally rigid. His eyes were open but unfocused, staring at some middle distance that existed only for him. His right hand moved continuously, drawing invisible patterns in the air with precise, mechanical movements.

Most unsettling, however, was what covered the floor around him.

Someone had provided him with chalk, and he had covered nearly every inch of accessible floorboard with intricate geometric patterns—shapes that seemed to fold in upon themselves in ways that strained the eye to follow. They weren't the typical circles and sigils of the superstitious, but complex mathematical expressions rendered in a visual language that Rivian found simultaneously familiar yet utterly foreign.

"Ah, Investigator Ashe." Magistrate Kallus turned at the sound of Rivian's footsteps. "Thank you for coming so promptly."

Rivian gave a slight bow. "Your message suggested urgency, Magistrate." He looked again at the seated clockmaker, who had given no indication that he noticed the new arrival. "What happened to Master Deverell?"

"That," said the Magistrate with unusual gravity, "is precisely what you are here to determine."

The young man stepped forward, his apprentice's apron stained with oil. "I found him like this when I arrived this morning, sir. The door was unlocked, which was strange already—Master Deverell is very particular about security. When he didn't respond to my greeting, I came upstairs and..." He gestured helplessly at the scene.

"Has he spoken?" Rivian asked.

"Oh yes," the physician interjected, "though nothing resembling sense. Mathematical formulas, mostly, interspersed with terms I've never encountered in any medical text or common language."

"May I?" Rivian gestured toward Deverell.

The physician stepped aside. "By all means, though he hasn't responded to any stimulus we've applied. It's as if he's entranced."

Rivian approached cautiously, carefully avoiding disturbing the chalk patterns on the floor. He studied the clockmaker's face—the slack expression, the slightly dilated pupils, the faint sheen of sweat despite the cool air of the workshop. Then he leaned in closer, noticing something unusual on the man's fingertips.

A faint residue clung to them, hardly visible in normal light. But as Rivian shifted his position, the substance caught the morning sunlight streaming through the window, and for the briefest moment, it seemed to shimmer with a color he couldn't quite name.

"Has anyone touched him?" Rivian asked, straightening up.

"I checked his pulse and reflexes," the physician said. "His apprentice guided him to the chair when he found him wandering among the patterns."

"And before that? Master Deverell was seen yesterday, I presume?"

The housekeeper spoke up. "Yes, sir. I served him dinner at seven bells. He was perfectly normal then, discussing an order for the Merchant Guild. He said he had some calculations to complete and retired to his workshop. I heard him moving about when I left at eight."

Rivian turned to the Magistrate. "I'd like to speak with anyone who had contact with Master Deverell in the past three days. And I'll need this room secured exactly as it is."

"You suspect foul play?" The Magistrate raised an eyebrow.

"I suspect nothing yet," Rivian replied, his eyes drawn back to the patterns on the floor. "But a man doesn't simply wake up one morning with knowledge he didn't possess the night before. These aren't the random scrawlings of madness, Magistrate. There's precision here. Purpose."

He gestured to one particularly complex pattern near the wall. "Look at the complexity, the mathematical precision. Master Deverell is a skilled craftsman, certainly, but this..." He shook his head. "This is something else entirely."

As if on cue, the clockmaker suddenly spoke, his voice eerily monotone yet carrying perfectly in the hushed room.

"The barriers are permeable. The spheres interpenetrate. Consciousness flows like water finding its level."

Then he smiled—a strange, knowing expression that didn't reach his vacant eyes—and returned to his silent pattern-drawing in the air.

A chill that had nothing to do with the autumn weather ran through the room. The apprentice made a warding sign, and even the physician took an involuntary step back.

Rivian kept his expression carefully neutral, but his mind was already methodically parsing what he'd observed, fitting the pieces into a framework that few would understand. He had spent five years at the Academy before choosing to leave—not long enough to learn their deeper secrets, but sufficient to recognize when something brushed against the boundaries of conventional understanding.

"I'll take the case," he said simply.

The Magistrate nodded, relief evident in his bearing. "I thought you might. What do you need?"

Rivian looked once more at the seated clockmaker, at the unknowable calculations flowing from his fingers, at the residue that shimmered with a color that shouldn't exist.

"Have guards posted. No one enters without my express permission. The physician may attend to Master Deverell's physical needs, but everything—his utterances, his drawings, any change in his condition—must be recorded." He turned to the apprentice. "Does your master keep a journal of his work?"

"Yes, sir. He's meticulous about his formulas and designs."

"Find it for me. And any correspondence from the past month."

As the others moved to comply with his directives, Rivian crouched near one of the patterns on the floor, careful not to touch it. Something about the design nagged at his memory—a lecture from his Academy days, perhaps, or a passage from one of the restricted texts he'd glimpsed in the library.

What he knew with certainty was that this case would lead him into dangerous territory. Not the ordinary dangers of criminal investigation, but the more insidious peril of knowledge that humans weren't meant to possess. During his brief time at the Academy, they had a saying: "Some doors, once opened, cannot be closed again."

He had a distinct feeling he was about to encounter such a door.

Rising to his feet, Rivian addressed the Magistrate one more time. "There's one other thing, sir. Has anyone reported similar incidents in the city? People acting strangely, displaying knowledge or abilities they shouldn't possess?"

The Magistrate frowned. "Not to my knowledge. Why do you ask?"

"A precaution," Rivian replied. "If this is an isolated incident, that suggests one kind of investigation. If not..." He left the implication hanging.

"I'll make inquiries," the Magistrate promised.

"Discreetly," Rivian emphasized. "Whatever affected Master Deverell, we don't want to cause a panic."

As the others filed out of the room, leaving only a guard posted at the stairway, Rivian turned back to study the seated clockmaker. In the quiet of the workshop, with only the soft ticking of dozens of timepieces as accompaniment, he allowed himself to acknowledge what he had immediately suspected but dared not voice.

Something—or someone—had reached into Master Deverell's mind and inscribed knowledge from beyond his sphere of understanding. Knowledge that his consciousness was not equipped to process.

And Rivian knew, with the cold certainty that had made him an exceptional investigator, that this was merely the beginning.

### Chapter 2: The Pattern Emerges

Three days after discovering Master Deverell in his unsettling state, Rivian Ashe found himself in the cramped office allocated to him by the Magistrate's department. Rain drummed against the single window, distorting the view of Northaven's slate rooftops. The small coal brazier in the corner did little to dispel the autumn chill, but Rivian barely noticed the cold as he arranged his notes into precise, overlapping rows on his desk.

Deverell had returned to consciousness yesterday morning, much to the relief of his apprentice. The clockmaker remembered nothing of his episode—or so he claimed. Rivian wasn't entirely convinced. There had been something in the man's eyes when questioned, a flicker of something that might have been fear, or perhaps recognition quickly suppressed.

"Nothing at all?" Rivian had pressed, watching Deverell's face carefully.

"I went to sleep in my bed after completing calculations for the Merchant Guild timepiece," Deverell had replied, his voice slightly hoarse from disuse. "Then I awoke with the physician and my apprentice hovering over me, and three days apparently gone from my life." His fingers had trembled as he reached for the tea his housekeeper had prepared, but his gaze remained steady. Too steady, perhaps.

A knock at his office door interrupted Rivian's recollections.

"Enter," he called, not looking up from his notes.

The door opened to admit a young woman in the practical uniform of a junior investigator. Her hair was pulled back in a severe knot, emphasizing sharp cheekbones and observant eyes. Lisbet Corwyn had been assigned as his assistant on this case, much to the displeasure of some of the more traditional investigators who considered her gender unsuitable for such work.

"The reports you requested, Investigator Ashe," she said, placing a leather folio on his desk. "Though I'm not sure why you wanted information on all unusual behaviors reported in the past week. Most are clearly unrelated—public drunkenness, religious ecstatics, the usual marketplace fortune-tellers causing scenes..."

"Thank you, Investigator Corwyn," Rivian replied, immediately opening the folio. "Unusual is unusual. Patterns emerge from seeming chaos when viewed from sufficient distance."

Lisbet lingered, her curiosity evident. "Have you made any progress with the clockmaker?"

Rivian glanced up, assessing her. She was new to the investigative division, transferred from records keeping due to her exceptional memory and attention to detail. Ambitious, but not recklessly so. Methodical. Potentially useful beyond mere paperwork.

"I've made observations," he said carefully. "Progress remains to be seen."

He turned his attention back to the reports, a clear dismissal, but Lisbet remained.

"There's something else," she said. "A report came in this morning that didn't make it into that folio. Professor Oren Valerian was found in his study at the University, speaking in mathematical formulas and drawing symbols on his chalkboard. The academic dean thought he was having some sort of scholarly breakthrough until Valerian didn't respond to questions and continued working for hours without rest."

Rivian's head snapped up. "When was this?"

"He was discovered yesterday morning, but apparently had been in that state since the night before."

"Current condition?"

"Still the same, according to the messenger. The University physician is attending him."

Rivian was already on his feet, reaching for his coat. "Have a carriage brought around. We're going to the University quarter."

---

The University of Northaven occupied an imposing complex of stone buildings on the city's western hill, overlooking both the prosperous upper districts and the sprawling lower city that extended to the harbor. Unlike the Academy, which kept its location and operations largely hidden from the general populace, the University operated in full view, providing education to the children of merchants and minor nobility in subjects deemed appropriately secular.

As their carriage passed through the ornate iron gates, Rivian glanced at the University's motto carved into the stone archway: "Knowledge Illuminates the Path." A statement that revealed both aspiration and limitation—illumination of an existing path rather than the creation of new ones. The Academy's unspoken motto, he recalled, was quite different: "Reality Yields to Understanding."

They were directed to the Natural Philosophy building, where Professor Valerian maintained his office and private research space. The academic dean, a nervous man with ink-stained fingers, met them at the entrance.

"Investigator Ashe, thank you for coming so promptly. I'm Dean Harwick. This is most unusual—Professor Valerian is one of our most distinguished faculty members, completely rational and methodical. This behavior is entirely out of character."

"Has anyone else been affected?" Rivian asked as they climbed the stairs to the professor's quarters.

"No, no, nothing like that. Though students are gossiping, of course. Claims of possession or madness spread quickly among the impressionable."

"When was the professor last seen in his normal state?"

The dean frowned in concentration. "He taught his advanced mathematics seminar the day before yesterday, ending at four bells. Students reported nothing unusual about his demeanor or lecture. He mentioned working on a personal research project that evening. When he failed to appear for his morning lecture yesterday, his assistant came to check on him and found... well, you'll see."

They reached a heavy wooden door with a brass nameplate reading "Prof. O. Valerian, Mathematics & Theoretical Harmonics." Dean Harwick knocked once before using a large key to unlock it.

The scene inside bore disturbing similarities to Deverell's workshop. Professor Valerian, a thin man with a shock of white hair, stood before a massive chalkboard that covered an entire wall. His hand moved continuously, adding equations to the dense mathematical forest that already filled every available space. Smaller chalkboards had been positioned around the room, similarly covered with notations. Where Deverell had drawn geometric patterns on his floor, Valerian had filled his chalkboards with equations that seemed to reference concepts beyond standard mathematics.

Unlike Deverell's silent concentration, however, Valerian muttered constantly, a stream of technical terminology interspersed with phrases that triggered Rivian's Academy-trained memory.

"...quantum entanglement across spheres of consciousness...perceptual frameworks as limiting boundaries...frequency resonance between thought patterns..."

A young man in scholar's robes sat nearby, frantically taking notes of everything the professor said. He looked up as they entered, dark circles under his eyes suggesting he had been at this task for many hours.

"No change, Aris?" asked the dean.

The young scholar shook his head. "He hasn't slept or eaten. I've managed to get him to drink some water, but he simply continues his work. It's extraordinary material—concepts I've never encountered in any of our texts."

Rivian moved closer to the professor, careful not to interrupt his work. He studied the man's appearance—the same dilated pupils he had observed in Deverell, the same slight sheen of sweat despite the cool room. And when Valerian's chalk hand paused momentarily, Rivian saw it—the same faint residue on the fingertips, catching the light at certain angles with that indefinable shimmer.

"Has he been examined by a physician?" Rivian asked.

"Yes," replied the dean. "Dr. Merrick found nothing physically wrong aside from mild exhaustion. He suggested we simply wait it out, that the professor might be experiencing some form of scholarly fugue state."

Rivian turned to the assistant. "Show me the exact notes the professor was working on before this episode began."

The young man—Aris—looked uncertainly at the dean, who nodded permission. Aris led Rivian to a desk in the corner where several journals lay open.

"He was working on harmonics theory—the mathematical relationship between musical frequencies. It's been his specialty for years." Aris pointed to the last normal entry, dated two days prior. "This is where his regular work ends. Everything after that..." He gestured helplessly at the chalkboards.

Rivian studied the journal, noting the precise handwriting and conventional mathematical notations. Nothing unusual or esoteric, nothing that hinted at the knowledge now pouring forth from the professor.

"Had Professor Valerian left the University grounds in the days before this incident?" Rivian asked.

The dean and assistant exchanged glances.

"He rarely leaves the University district," said Aris. "But yes, the day before this happened, he mentioned needing to procure a specific text from Cobrand's Bookshop in the central market square. He was gone for several hours in the afternoon."

The market square. Rivian made a mental note. "Did he find the book he was seeking?"

"No," Aris replied. "He seemed rather distracted when he returned, said something about an 'unexpected encounter' that gave him a new perspective on his research. I assumed he'd met a colleague or perhaps had some insight while walking."

Rivian turned to Lisbet, who had been silently observing the scene. "Record everything on these chalkboards," he instructed. "Complete copies, not summaries."

"That would take days," protested the dean. "And much of it appears to be nonsensical—"

"It is not nonsensical," Rivian cut him off. "It is beyond your sphere of understanding, which is not the same thing." He winced internally at his choice of words—too close to Academy terminology—but the dean merely looked offended rather than suspicious.

"Copy the two primary boards," Rivian amended, indicating the most densely covered chalkboards. "Focus on any recurring symbols or terms."

As Lisbet set to work, Rivian approached Professor Valerian again. This time, he intentionally moved into the professor's line of sight. For a moment, there was no reaction, then Valerian's eyes focused on him with sudden clarity.

"You," the professor said, his chalk hand temporarily stilling. "You stand at the threshold. You've glimpsed it before, haven't you? The patterns beneath perception."

The room fell silent. Even the dean stopped fidgeting with his sleeve buttons.

"What patterns, Professor?" Rivian asked quietly.

Valerian smiled—the same unsettling smile Rivian had seen on Deverell's face. "Reality is malleable to those who understand its grammar. We are taught to perceive so little, to accept such narrow bands of awareness. But there are methods to expand perception, to elevate consciousness beyond its natural sphere."

He leaned closer to Rivian, dropping his voice to a whisper that nevertheless carried in the silent room. "She opened a door in my mind. Just a crack. Just enough to let the light in. Do you want to see what I've seen, Investigator? Do you want to know what lies beyond the veil?"

Before Rivian could respond, Valerian's eyes unfocused again, and he turned back to his chalkboard, resuming his calculations as if the interaction had never occurred.

Rivian stepped back, his mind racing. Not a random episode. Not isolated. Targeted. And whoever "she" was, she had known Valerian was a professor—had selected him specifically.

"I've seen enough for now," he said. "Maintain your vigil, and send word immediately if there's any change in his condition."

Outside in the corridor, Lisbet caught up with him. "Sir, there was something familiar about those equations. I've seen similar notations in the records room, in the restricted section where we keep confiscated cult materials."

Rivian raised an eyebrow. "You have access to the restricted archives?"

She flushed slightly. "I was tasked with reorganizing the filing system. Some of the symbols on the professor's board resembled those in texts seized from The Enlightened Order of the Cosmic Sphere about five years ago."

"The what?"

"A fringe group that claimed to have discovered methods to 'elevate consciousness beyond mortal limitations.' They were disbanded after several members suffered mental breakdowns. The Magistrate classified them as a harmful cult."

Rivian felt a chill that had nothing to do with the drafty hallway. "I want those records on my desk by evening."

---

Back in his office, Rivian added his observations of Professor Valerian to his notes on Deverell. Two cases, both involving educated men suddenly displaying knowledge beyond their training, both exhibiting the same physical symptoms, both having visited the market square shortly before their episodes.

As he worked, a messenger arrived with a sealed note bearing the Magistrate's personal mark. Inside was a terse message:

*Dockworker at East Wharf displaying similar symptoms to Deverell case. Dock foreman reports man drawing strange symbols in salt spilled on warehouse floor. Investigate immediately. —Magistrate Kallus*

Rivian grabbed his coat once more. Three cases now. A pattern was emerging, but its full shape remained tantalizingly obscured.

By the time he reached the East Wharf, a small crowd had gathered outside one of the larger warehouses. The dock foreman, a barrel-chested man with sailor's tattoos visible at his collar, met Rivian at the entrance.

"Right peculiar business, Investigator. Torvald's one of my best workers—strong as an ox and about as talkative. Shows up every day, does his work without complaint. This morning he's helping unload salt cargo when suddenly he goes still as stone, then starts drawing in the spilled salt like some fancy court artist."

Inside the warehouse, the scene had become familiar to Rivian: a man separated from reality, focused entirely on creating patterns that shouldn't exist in his mind. Unlike the previous cases, this man—Torvald—worked with crude materials. Using his fingers in spilled salt, he had created intricate crystalline patterns across the warehouse floor, patterns that echoed the mathematical precision of Deverell's chalk drawings and Valerian's equations.

Rivian observed the same physical symptoms—the dilated pupils, the faint sheen of sweat, the residue on the fingertips that caught the light strangely. But this case was different in one significant respect: Torvald was unquestionably unlettered, yet the symbols he drew contained complex mathematical relationships that would challenge even University scholars.

"Has he spoken?" Rivian asked a fellow dockworker who stood nearby.

"Aye, but nothing that makes sense. Numbers and nonsense words, like he's possessed by some counting demon."

As if on cue, Torvald spoke, his normally gruff voice eerily melodic. "Consciousness cascades through seven spheres of being, each a step on the ladder of perception. The boundaries between spheres are not walls but veils, permeable to those with the knowledge to pass through."

Rivian felt his mouth go dry. Those were Academy concepts—closely guarded knowledge about the nature of consciousness that even he, with his limited Fifth Circle training, had only heard mentioned in theoretical contexts. How could a dockworker possibly know such things?

"When did this start?" he asked the foreman.

"About three hours ago. He was normal when the shift began at dawn."

"And before today? Any unusual behavior in recent days?"

The foreman scratched his beard. "Come to think of it, he did ask for unusual time off two days ago. Said he needed to visit the market for his wife's nameday gift. Strange for Torvald—he's not one for sentiment or shopping."

The market square again. Three different men, three different social positions, all visiting the market shortly before their episodes.

"I need this area secured," Rivian instructed. "No one touches him or disturbs his work. I'll have a physician sent to monitor his condition."

As he was leaving the warehouse, another messenger approached, this one bearing the insignia of the Merchant Council.

"Investigator Ashe? I'm instructed to inform you that Dalia Merrick, daughter of Councilor Merrick, has been found in her chamber speaking in unknown languages and drawing unusual designs on her bedroom walls. The family physician is attending her, but the Councilor specifically requested your assistance given your current investigation."

Four cases. In less than a week.

---

By nightfall, Rivian had confirmed the pattern. Dalia Merrick, like the others, had visited the central market square the day before her episode. Unlike the men, who had all gone alone on specific errands, she had been shopping with her lady's maid, but had separated briefly to explore a stall that caught her interest.

"I couldn't see which one from where I was standing," the maid had explained tearfully. "When she returned, she seemed distracted but insisted nothing was wrong. This morning I found her like this." She gestured to the young woman who sat in the center of her elegantly appointed bedroom, drawing complex patterns on sheets of expensive paper provided by her concerned parents.

The same symptoms. The same residue on her fingertips. The same uncanny knowledge expressed through her drawings and occasional utterances.

Back in his office well after midnight, Rivian assembled his evidence while the city slept. Four cases across different social strata. Four individuals who should have no connection to one another, all affected in identical ways after visiting the same market square.

Something—or someone—was targeting these people deliberately. The market connection suggested a physical presence, perhaps a person or object that somehow transferred this strange knowledge to the victims. But how? There had been no reports of assault, no suspicious substances discovered in their possession.

The victims shared no obvious characteristics. Different ages, genders, social positions, education levels. Yet all exhibited the same symptoms, the same sudden access to knowledge beyond their sphere of understanding.

Lisbet had delivered the promised cult records earlier that evening. The Enlightened Order of the Cosmic Sphere had indeed used similar mathematical notations in their rituals, claiming they represented "the underlying structure of reality." Their leader, a former University professor named Caius Voth, had disappeared after the cult's disbandment five years ago, presumed to have fled the city to escape prosecution.

Could Voth have returned? Was this some continuation of his cult's work?

Rivian rubbed his eyes, fatigue finally catching up to him. Tomorrow he would begin surveillance of the market square, watching for anything unusual, any pattern in the movements of the crowds that might reveal his quarry.

As he was gathering his notes to leave, a final messenger arrived—this one from the physician attending Master Deverell.

*Investigator Ashe,*

*I thought you should know immediately that Master Deverell has recovered fully and has been cleared to return to his normal activities. He claims to remember nothing of his episode, though he reports unusual dreams. Most interestingly, the complex chalk patterns he created have completely faded from his workshop floor, despite no cleaning having been performed. I inspected the area myself and found not a trace of chalk remaining.*

*Respectfully,*
*Dr. Harlow*

Rivian stared at the note for a long moment. Patterns that disappear without a trace. Knowledge that arrives and departs mysteriously. People targeted across the city for reasons he couldn't yet fathom.

Whatever he was investigating, it went beyond mere madness or criminal mischief. Something was reaching into the minds of Northaven's citizens, leaving its mark, and then withdrawing—but to what purpose?

The answer, he suspected, waited somewhere in the crowded pathways of the central market square. And tomorrow, he would begin hunting for it.

As he finally headed home through the quiet streets, Rivian found himself unusually aware of the shadows between buildings, the spaces where light didn't quite reach. For the first time since leaving the Academy, he felt the uncomfortable sensation of being watched by eyes he couldn't see, assessed by standards he couldn't comprehend.

Something had disturbed the boundary between spheres of understanding in Northaven. And whether by design or by accident, Rivian had placed himself directly in its path.

### Chapter 3: The Market Square

The central market square of Northaven had existed since the city's founding centuries ago. What had begun as a simple gathering place for farmers and craftsmen had evolved into a sprawling maze of permanent stalls, seasonal pavilions, and wandering vendors. The square itself was no longer square at all, but rather a complex network of alleyways and small plazas that spread like veins through the heart of the city.

Rivian arrived before dawn, watching traders set up their stalls by lantern light. He had dressed in plain clothes—a merchant's simple jacket and worn boots that would attract no attention. The elaborate gray coat that marked him as a Magistrate's investigator remained hanging in his quarters.

He chose an unobtrusive position on the second floor of a teahouse that afforded a view of the square's main thoroughfare. The establishment's owner, a thin woman named Meris who occasionally provided information to the Magistrate's office, asked no questions when he requested the corner table by the window.

"Planning to be here all day?" she asked, placing a pot of strong black tea before him.

"Possibly longer," Rivian replied, sliding her several coins. "I may need food brought periodically."

Meris nodded, pocketing the money. "Anything in particular you're watching for?"

"Unusual patterns," he said simply. When her eyebrow raised in question, he added, "You've been here for years. Have you noticed any new vendors or attractions in the past two weeks? Anyone drawing unusual crowds?"

She considered this as she wiped down his table. "Market's always changing with the seasons. The Harvest Fair brought in some traveling folk last week—musicians, a puppeteer, the usual sort. Only odd one might be the fortune teller. Sets up a small tent, different spot each day. Popular with both fancy folk and dock workers, which isn't common."

Rivian sipped his tea to mask his interest. "Fortune tellers are hardly unusual in market squares."

"This one's different. Blind woman, or appears to be—wears a dark cloth over her eyes. Doesn't use cards or crystal balls or any of the usual tricks. Just asks questions and tells you things about yourself. Some say she's uncannily accurate." Meris shrugged. "Haven't visited her myself. Don't need to pay someone to tell me my future's full of brewing tea and sweeping floors."

"How long has she been here?"

"About two weeks. Appeared right after the Harvest Fair started."

Rivian nodded his thanks as Meris moved away to attend to other early customers. Two weeks—coinciding perfectly with the timeline of the afflictions. His first victim, Master Deverell, had fallen into his trance-like state twelve days ago. The timing fit.

He settled in for a long day of observation, his notebook open on the table before him. Years at the Academy had taught him patience—the ability to watch without judgment, to observe without immediate interpretation. It was a skill that had served him well as an investigator, though he rarely spoke of its origins.

By mid-morning, the square was bustling with activity. Rivian meticulously mapped the locations and movements of every vendor, noting which attracted the most customers, which were avoided, which appeared to be selling goods versus those offering services.

Shortly before noon, he spotted her—a slender figure in dark blue robes setting up a small tent in an alcove near the western edge of the square. Even from his elevated position, Rivian could see the dark cloth wrapped around her eyes and upper face. She moved with surprising grace for one who appeared blind, setting out a small stool beside her tent.

Within minutes, a small queue had formed. Rivian watched as each person was led inside the tent for a consultation that lasted between eight and twelve minutes by his pocket watch—slightly longer than would be expected for a standard fortune-telling performance.

More interesting was the behavior of those who emerged. Each one paused momentarily after exiting, as if orienting themselves. Most reached up to touch their temples briefly before continuing on their way. The gesture was so consistent that it could not be coincidental.

Around mid-afternoon, Lisbet arrived at the teahouse as instructed, dressed similarly in modest attire that would not draw attention.

"You found something," she stated rather than asked, noting his focused attention out the window.

"Possibly," Rivian replied. "The blind fortune teller in the blue tent. Every person who exits touches their temples in the same manner, as if experiencing a momentary discomfort."

Lisbet watched for several minutes, confirming his observation. "A suggestion, perhaps? Something she says that makes them check for a headache?"

"Perhaps." Rivian pushed a few coins across the table. "I need you to have your fortune told."

To her credit, Lisbet didn't hesitate. "What am I looking for?"

"Everything. The interior arrangement of the tent. Her exact words. Any physical contact she attempts to make. Any unusual sensations you experience. And most importantly, whether she asks questions about your dreams, memories, or childhood."

"You suspect some form of hypnotic suggestion?"

"I suspect nothing yet," Rivian corrected. "I observe and gather information. But be careful—if she is responsible for what happened to Deverell and the others, there's no telling what effect she might have."

Lisbet nodded and departed, making her way casually across the square to join the short queue at the fortune teller's tent. Rivian watched through the teahouse window as she waited her turn, maintaining a practiced air of mild curiosity rather than investigative intent.

When Lisbet finally entered the tent, Rivian found himself counting the minutes with unusual attention. Eight minutes passed, then ten, then twelve—the average time for other consultations. When she had not emerged by the fifteen-minute mark, he felt the first stirring of concern.

At eighteen minutes, just as he was considering direct intervention, Lisbet emerged. Like the others, she paused, seeming momentarily disoriented. Her hand rose to her temple in the now-familiar gesture. Then she looked around, her gaze eventually finding the teahouse window where Rivian sat.

Something in her expression sent a chill through him. It wasn't fear, exactly, but a kind of bewilderment—as if she had witnessed something her mind couldn't properly process.

She made her way back to the teahouse, her movements slightly more hesitant than her usual confident stride. When she rejoined him at his table, Rivian pushed a fresh cup of tea toward her.

"Drink," he said quietly. "It helps."

She complied without questioning how he would know such a thing.

"Report," Rivian prompted after she had taken several sips.

Lisbet set down her cup carefully. "It was... strange. The tent seems larger inside than outside, though I know that must be an illusion of some kind. The angles..." She frowned, struggling to articulate her observation. "The corners of the tent didn't meet properly. I couldn't focus on them directly."

"The fortune teller herself?"

"Tall, thin woman. Older, but not elderly. The cloth over her eyes appears to be silk, completely opaque. Her voice is unusual—almost musical, with an accent I couldn't place." Lisbet glanced down at her hands, which Rivian noted were trembling slightly. "She never touched me, but I felt as if... as if she was looking into my head. Not reading my thoughts exactly, but examining them, like a collector sorting through specimens."

Rivian's attention sharpened. "What questions did she ask you?"

"That's the strangest part. She asked about my dreams—specifically, if I'd ever dreamed of flying or falling from great heights. Then she asked about my earliest memory, and whether I'd ever experienced moments where I felt I could sense what others were thinking." Lisbet looked up, her professional composure reasserting itself. "These match the questions reported by the cult documents I found—The Enlightened Order used similar inquiries to identify 'potential elevates' within their membership."

"Did she make any predictions about your future?"

"Not exactly. She said I 'stood at the threshold of greater perception' and that I had 'the potential to see beyond the veil of common understanding.' It sounded like practiced mysticism, but..." Lisbet hesitated. "When she spoke those words, the air in the tent seemed to change. Colors became more vivid. I could see... patterns in the fabric of her robes that hadn't been visible before. For just a moment, it was as if everything was connected by invisible threads of light."

Rivian kept his expression neutral with effort. What Lisbet was describing sounded uncomfortably like the early stages of mana perception—the beginning awareness of reality's underlying currents that marked the transition toward the Seventh Sphere of consciousness. Such awareness typically developed gradually over years of study and focused meditation, not in moments within a market fortune teller's tent.

"Did she give you anything? Or take anything from you?"

Lisbet shook her head. "No. Wait—" She frowned, turning her wrist over to examine it. "This wasn't here before."

On the inside of her wrist was a mark so faint it was barely visible—a small spiral pattern that seemed to shimmer slightly when viewed from certain angles. Rivian recognized the same indefinable quality he had observed on the fingertips of the afflicted.

"Do not touch it," he said sharply as Lisbet raised her other hand to examine the mark. "Does it hurt or cause any unusual sensation?"

"No. I didn't even notice it until now." She studied it more closely. "It almost looks like it's beneath the skin rather than on it."

Rivian made a quick sketch of the mark in his notebook, then checked his pocket watch. "We need to monitor this. Report any unusual thoughts, dreams, or perceptions immediately, no matter how trivial they seem."

"You think she's targeting people for these... episodes?"

"I think she's evaluating potential," Rivian replied, his gaze returning to the fortune teller's tent across the square. "The question is, potential for what? And to what purpose?"

They spent the remainder of the day observing the fortune teller's operation. She saw approximately twenty-five clients before closing her tent shortly before sunset. Unlike other vendors who packed their wares onto carts, she simply collapsed the small tent into a bundle that she carried away herself, disappearing down one of the narrow streets leading from the square.

Rivian considered following her, but decided against it. He had found his connection point—now he needed to understand the mechanism of affliction and the pattern of victim selection.

"Return to the office and document everything about your experience," he instructed Lisbet. "I want a complete report by morning, including any changes in that mark or your perceptions."

She nodded, but hesitated before leaving. "Sir... what is happening to these people? Is it some form of poison or hypnosis?"

"If it were merely chemical or psychological, I would not have been assigned to the case," Rivian answered carefully. "There are aspects of our world that the average citizen doesn't perceive, Investigator Corwyn. Sometimes that limitation is a mercy."

---

Rivian returned to the market square before dawn the next day, taking up the same observation post in the teahouse. As Meris had mentioned, the fortune teller set up her tent in a different location—this time near the eastern section close to the flower vendors.

He watched throughout the morning, noting that while her location changed, her method of operation remained identical. The same small tent, the same individual consultations, the same gesture from clients as they departed.

Shortly after noon, he spotted a familiar face entering the fortune teller's tent—a middle-aged woman in the modest attire of domestic staff. It took him a moment to place her: Deverell's housekeeper. She had not mentioned visiting the fortune teller during his investigation at the clockmaker's workshop.

Rivian slipped out of the teahouse and made his way across the square, positioning himself where he could intercept the housekeeper after her consultation. When she emerged twelve minutes later, making the now-familiar gesture toward her temples, he stepped forward.

"Good day," he said pleasantly. "You work for Master Deverell, do you not?"

The woman started, clearly recognizing him. "Investigator Ashe! I was just... that is..." She glanced back at the tent nervously.

"How many times have you visited the fortune teller?" Rivian asked, keeping his tone conversational.

"This was my second visit," she admitted. "The first was nearly two weeks ago, right before... before Master Deverell fell ill. She told me such remarkable things about myself—things nobody could possibly know. I wanted to ask if she had any insight into what happened to him."

"And did she?"

The housekeeper frowned. "She said something strange. That he had 'glimpsed beyond his capability to comprehend' and that he would recover but 'retain shadows of elevated perception.' I don't know what that means, but she seemed to know about his condition without me explaining it."

"Did you visit the fortune teller before or after Master Deverell that day?"

"After, I believe. I saw him leaving the market as I was arriving for my half-day. He mentioned having an errand at the watchmaker's guild hall." She paused, realization dawning. "You think this fortune teller had something to do with what happened to him?"

"I'm gathering information," Rivian replied neutrally. "Did you notice anything unusual about Master Deverell after he recovered? Any change in his behavior or speech?"

The housekeeper thought for a moment. "Now that you mention it, he's been different in small ways. More distracted. I've found him staring at ordinary objects—a teacup, the pattern in the carpet—as if seeing something remarkable. And he's been having nightmares. I've heard him cry out in his sleep."

This matched what Rivian had observed himself in their brief interaction after Deverell's recovery—the careful control, the deliberate neutrality that suggested suppression rather than absence of memory.

"Thank you for your insight," Rivian said. "I would suggest avoiding further consultations with the fortune teller for the time being."

The housekeeper nodded, clearly relieved to have a reason to stay away from the tent despite her curiosity.

As she departed, Rivian considered his options. He now had a strong suspicion that the fortune teller was involved in the afflictions sweeping through Northaven, but the exact mechanism remained unclear. Was she somehow transferring knowledge to her selected visitors? Or merely activating something already latent within them?

The question of selection criteria still troubled him. If she could affect Deverell's housekeeper, why didn't she? What made some visitors suitable candidates while others were merely provided with a conventional fortune-telling experience?

His thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of a city guard, slightly out of breath from hurrying.

"Investigator Ashe? The Magistrate sent me to find you. There's been a development in one of your cases. Master Deverell has been found dead in his workshop."

---

The scene at Deverell's workshop defied rational explanation. The clockmaker's body lay contorted on the floor, limbs bent at angles that would be impossible in life, as if his bones had softened and reformed. His face was frozen in an expression of either ecstasy or agony—perhaps both. Most disturbing was the position of his head, turned nearly backwards on his neck, eyes open and staring at the ceiling.

"The apprentice found him this morning," explained the city guard who had summoned Rivian. "Poor lad's half out of his mind with shock."

Dr. Harlow, the same physician who had attended Deverell during his affliction, stood beside the body, his professional composure visibly shaken.

"I've never seen anything like it," he admitted when Rivian approached. "It's as if every joint in his body dislocated simultaneously, allowing this... configuration. Yet there's no sign of struggle or external trauma. No evidence of poison that I can detect."

"Cause of death?" Rivian asked, crouching to examine the body more closely.

"Impossible to determine without a full examination, but preliminary observation suggests total system failure—heart, lungs, and brain ceasing function simultaneously." The doctor shook his head. "I've never encountered such a case in thirty years of practice."

Rivian studied the workshop, looking for changes since his last visit. The chalk patterns that had covered the floor were indeed gone without a trace, as the doctor's note had indicated. But there was something new—a faint, almost imperceptible shimmer in the air above the body, visible only when viewed from certain angles.

"Has anything been moved since he was discovered?" Rivian asked.

"Nothing. The apprentice had the presence of mind to send for the guard immediately, who then sent for me and the Magistrate." Dr. Harlow gestured to a nearby workbench. "Though I did notice something unusual there."

On the clockmaker's desk lay a half-assembled timepiece surrounded by precision tools. Beside it was a journal, open to a page filled with diagrams and calculations. Rivian approached carefully, immediately recognizing that these were not conventional horological formulas. The notation system resembled what Deverell had drawn during his affliction—complex mathematical expressions that went far beyond what a clockmaker would need or understand.

"When did he write this?" Rivian asked, examining the journal without touching it.

"According to the apprentice, Master Deverell had been working late every night since recovering from his... episode. Said he had new ideas for chronometric mechanisms that needed to be explored." The doctor lowered his voice. "The lad thought his master had made a miraculous recovery, perhaps even experienced some sort of inspiration during his affliction."

Rivian carefully turned the pages of the journal using a pencil, revealing dozens of entries written in Deverell's precise hand but containing concepts no clockmaker should possess. Equations describing higher-dimensional mathematics, references to "temporal elasticity" and "consciousness diffraction," sketches of mechanisms that appeared to defy basic physical principles.

Most telling were the coded references to "elevation" and "sphere boundaries" scattered throughout the later entries—Academy terminology disguised within horological metaphors. Deverell had retained far more from his affliction than he had admitted, and had been attempting to implement this dangerous knowledge in his craft.

The final entry, dated the previous evening, read simply: *"The boundaries between spheres are permeable. I have seen beyond the veil. I cannot un-see. I cannot un-know. If consciousness determines reality, then expanded consciousness must, by necessity, expand reality itself. I must attempt the crossing."*

Rivian closed the journal grimly. This was no longer merely a case of strange afflictions—it had become a matter of life and death. Someone was deliberately exposing ordinary citizens to knowledge beyond their sphere of understanding, with catastrophic results.

"The body must be secured," he instructed the guard. "No one is to examine it further without my explicit authorization. And this workshop is to be sealed—nothing removed, nothing disturbed."

As they were preparing to leave, the apprentice appeared in the doorway, his young face haggard with grief and shock.

"He said something, before I found him this morning," the young man said hesitantly. "I heard his voice through the door, but when I entered, he was already... like this." He swallowed hard. "He said: 'She promised elevation, but the mind cannot support what the soul is not ready to perceive.'"

Rivian felt a cold certainty settle in his chest. The fortune teller wasn't simply identifying potential victims—she was actively promising them something. Elevation. Expanded perception. A glimpse beyond the veil that separated ordinary consciousness from higher understanding.

And that promise was killing them.

---

By the time Rivian returned to his office that evening, reports had arrived of the other victims' conditions. Professor Valerian had recovered consciousness that morning, remembering nothing of his episode. The dockworker Torvald had also returned to normal, seeming confused but otherwise unharmed. Only Dalia Merrick remained in her trance-like state, though her physician reported signs of emerging awareness.

Most concerning was Lisbet's report, waiting on his desk. The mark on her wrist had faded completely within hours of her visit to the fortune teller, but she reported unusual dreams that night—dreams of floating above the city, seeing patterns of light connecting all living things.

*"I know these were merely dreams,"* her report concluded, *"but they possessed a clarity and coherence unlike ordinary dream-states. Upon waking, I found myself noticing subtle patterns in everyday objects that I had never perceived before—the mathematical precision of leaf arrangements on plants, the geometric relationships between architectural elements. These observations fade within minutes, but the experience is... unsettling."*

Rivian sat at his desk, assembling the evidence before him. The fortune teller was clearly the connection between all cases. She appeared to be evaluating individuals, marking some but afflicting only a few. Those afflicted gained temporary access to knowledge beyond their sphere—knowledge that faded when they recovered, though perhaps not completely, as Deverell's case suggested.

But why had Deverell died while the others recovered? What made his case different?

As he pondered this question, a knock at his door interrupted his thoughts. Without waiting for a response, the door opened to reveal Magistrate Kallus himself, accompanied by a thin man in nondescript dark clothing.

"Investigator Ashe," the Magistrate said formally. "This is Archivist Neven from the Municipal Records Office. He has been assigned to assist with documentation for your current case."

Rivian rose slowly from his desk, immediately recognizing the subtle signs that marked the thin man as something other than a municipal functionary. The precise posture, the unusually aware eyes that cataloged everything in the room in seconds, the faint scar at the temple that resulted from certain Academy training exercises.

"Archivist," Rivian acknowledged with a slight bow. "I was unaware that the Municipal Records Office took an interest in ongoing investigations."

"Only those with potential historical significance," replied Neven smoothly. "The Magistrate has informed me of the unusual nature of these cases. They may require special documentation methods."

The message was clear enough. The Academy had become aware of the situation and had sent an observer—possibly an operative. The fact that they were working through official channels rather than simply taking over the investigation suggested they were still assessing the nature and scope of the threat.

"I've informed Archivist Neven of your progress thus far," said the Magistrate. "He will review your notes and evidence collection, ensuring everything is properly preserved for the official record."

"Of course," Rivian replied, gesturing to the organized files on his desk. "Though I should note that my investigation is at a delicate stage. Any disruption to my approach could jeopardize results."

"I assure you, Investigator, I'm merely here to observe and document," said Neven. Something in his tone made the hairs on the back of Rivian's neck rise. "Though I might suggest that certain avenues of investigation could prove... hazardous without proper preparation."

After the Magistrate departed, Neven closed the office door and turned to Rivian with a markedly different demeanor.

"Fifth Circle training, if I recall correctly," he said without preamble. "Incomplete, of course, as you left before formal elevation. Still, you recognize what's happening here, don't you?"

Rivian kept his expression neutral. "I recognize symptoms consistent with exposure to knowledge beyond the subjects' sphere of understanding."

"Indeed." Neven moved closer, lowering his voice despite the closed door. "Someone is attempting forced elevation of consciousness—dragging ordinary minds across sphere boundaries they are not prepared to cross. The Academy takes such violations very seriously."

"Is that why you're here? To contain the situation?"

"I'm here to determine the exact nature of the violation. Once identified, appropriate measures will be taken." Neven's eyes narrowed slightly. "In the meantime, I strongly advise you to terminate your direct investigation. This matter will be handled by those with proper training and protection."

The warning was clear, but Rivian had spent years building his reputation as Northaven's most thorough investigator. He wasn't about to abandon a case on the word of an Academy operative, especially when lives were clearly at stake.

"I appreciate your concern, Archivist Neven, but I have my duties to the Magistrate. My investigation will continue until ordered otherwise."

Neven studied him for a long moment. "Your choice, Investigator Ashe. But consider this: Deverell won't be the last to die. What you're facing is not crime as you understand it. It's reality manipulation of the most dangerous kind—the kind that breaks minds and bodies when improperly applied." He moved toward the door. "For your own safety, stay away from the blind fortune teller. She is not what she appears to be."

After Neven departed, Rivian sat motionless at his desk, weighing his options. The Academy's involvement confirmed his worst suspicions about the nature of the case. What had at first seemed merely strange had escalated to fatal, and now threatened to expand further.

His years at the Academy, though terminated before completion, had taught him enough to recognize the danger. Consciousness existed in distinct spheres, with transitions between them occurring naturally through study, meditation, and personal development. Forced elevation—artificially inducing higher sphere awareness in unprepared minds—was strictly forbidden by Academy law, not from arbitrary restriction but because the consequences were inevitably destructive.

Deverell had died because he had glimpsed something his mind couldn't safely process, and then had foolishly attempted to implement that knowledge. The others would remain at risk as long as the fortune teller continued her work.

Despite Neven's warning—or perhaps because of it—Rivian knew he could not abandon the investigation. Too many lives were at stake, including possibly Lisbet's, given her report of unusual perceptions.

Tomorrow, he would need to make a more direct approach. He would send assistants to follow the fortune teller when she left the market, establishing where she resided. He would interview the recovered victims more thoroughly, seeking patterns in their experiences. And he would continue monitoring the market square, watching for how she selected her targets.

As night fell over Northaven, Rivian finally left his office, walking the quiet streets toward his modest lodgings. The autumn air had turned sharper, carrying the promise of early frost. He pulled his coat tighter against the chill, his mind still working through the complexities of the case.

He had nearly reached his street when an unusual sensation passed over him—a momentary feeling of being observed not just physically but somehow deeper, as if his very thoughts were being examined. He turned quickly, scanning the shadows between buildings, but saw nothing.

Yet the feeling persisted. Someone—or something—was watching him with more than ordinary senses. The fortune teller? An Academy observer? Or something else entirely?

The warning Neven had delivered took on a more personal dimension. This case had placed Rivian directly in the path of forces he only partially understood—forces that manipulated consciousness itself as a medium. He had positioned himself between the fortune teller and her victims, making himself a potential target.

As he finally reached his door, the certainty settled within him like a stone. He was being watched, assessed, measured against some unknown standard. The question that would determine his fate was simple: did he fit the fortune teller's criteria for "elevation"?

And if he did, would he survive the experience that had already claimed Deverell's life?
