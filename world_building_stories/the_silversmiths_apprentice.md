# The Silversmith's Apprentice

*From the journal of Elodin Talfrey, silversmith's apprentice in the city of Harthaven, Fourth Sphere citizen of the Western Kingdoms, 357th year of the Third Age*

I am no sage or scholar, and Nera laughs at my awkward letters, but Master Talmuk insists I keep this journal. He says a proper craftsman must train the mind as well as the hands. Five years I've been his apprentice, and this is the first time he's asked me to write down my thoughts. Perhaps when I mentioned that the silver from the new eastern vein "felt different" under my hammer, he finally saw something in me beyond a pair of hands to polish his wares.

Today marks my first successful working of what Master Talmuk calls "blessed silver." The pendant I crafted holds a curious quality—it glows with a soft blue radiance that waxes and wanes with the wearer's breath. Master Talmuk was unusually pleased, watching me work with eyes that seemed to measure more than just my technique. When I asked how the metal could glow without heat, he merely said some ores that form in special places carry unusual properties.

I must record what Master Talmuk taught me about working this strange silver, lest I forget:

> "This special metal doesn't wish to be shaped like ordinary silver; it must be persuaded, not forced. Listen to how it sings against the anvil—when the note changes from resistance to acceptance, that is your moment to strike true."

I confess I heard no singing, but I felt *something* when the hammer fell just right—a vibration that traveled up my arm and settled somewhere behind my eyes. For a moment, I swear I could see the pattern the metal wanted to take, like a whispered suggestion rather than a vision.

Three days have passed, and the Governor's daughter now wears my pendant. Master Talmuk took all the coin, of course, but allowed me to accompany him to the Governor's manor for the presentation. I have never seen such luxury—even the servant quarters likely outshine the entire street where my family dwells.

I stood silent as Master explained the pendant's unusual qualities, watching the girl's face light up when the blue glow pulsed in time with her excited breathing. What struck me most, however, was the robed man standing in the corner, observing with keen interest. His sleeves bore the silver spiral of the Academy—a sage of high standing by his bearing alone.

When the Governor and his daughter left to show off the trinket to the rest of the household, the sage approached. Up close, his eyes held an unsettling depth, as though I were being measured against some standard I could not comprehend.

"You shaped this, boy?" he asked, voice surprisingly ordinary for one whose knowledge must be vast.

Master Talmuk began to speak, but the sage raised a hand to silence him. "I asked the apprentice."

My tongue felt thick, but I managed, "Yes, sir. Under Master Talmuk's guidance."

"And have you worked with such special metal before?"

"No, sir. This was my first time with this particular ore."

He nodded slowly, reaching into his robe to extract a small cloth bag. He handed it to Master Talmuk. "I would like to commission a similar piece. The material is inside. Your apprentice will work it."

Master began to protest that he himself would—

"The boy only," the sage interrupted. "Or not at all."

After the sage departed, Master opened the bag with trembling fingers. Inside lay a sliver of something that resembled silver but gleamed with an inner light that shifted between emerald and sapphire. Master's face paled.

"Star metal," he whispered. "From the heavens themselves."

I did not understand the significance then. I do now.

Two weeks have passed since my last entry. My hands tremble as I write this, though whether from exhaustion or excitement, I cannot say.

The sage's star metal nearly broke me. Seven failed attempts left me feverish and doubting. The material—if it can truly be called metal—resisted every technique Master Talmuk had taught me. It grew hot when I least expected, cold when the forge was at its highest heat. It seemed to move beneath my hammer, always a whisper away from where I struck.

In desperation on the eighth day, I stopped trying to shape it according to Master's teachings. Instead, I sat with it through the night, the small sliver resting in my palm. I spoke to it—foolishness, I know—telling it of my family, of our struggles when the mountain mines closed, of my younger sister's cough that never quite clears in winter. 

I must have fallen asleep, for I dreamed of stars falling, of light cascading through darkness like water, of voices singing in harmonies I could almost grasp.

When I woke at dawn, the metal had softened in my hand, warm as fresh bread. It yielded to my touch like clay, and I shaped it without forge or hammer, my fingers knowing what to do though my mind did not. By sunrise, I held a ring the color of twilight, bands of silver and otherworldly metal intertwined like lovers.

Master Talmuk found me cradling it, tear-streaked and babbling. He made me lie down while he examined the ring. I heard his sharp intake of breath, saw him test it with tools and reagents I didn't recognize. Finally, he sat heavily beside my pallet.

"Elodin," he said, using my given name for perhaps the first time, "do you know what you've done?"

I shook my head.

"You've shaped this material when—" He paused, searching for words. "When it should have been impossible for you to do so. Only..." He stopped, looking at me differently than before. "I must send word to Scholar Thorne immediately."

"Is the ring... special?" I asked.

"Not yet," Master Talmuk said cryptically. "But it will be."

I sleep poorly tonight, the ring locked in Master's strongbox. Dreams of stars and singing still echo in my mind, but now I hear words in the music, just beyond understanding.

What is happening to me?

---

The sage's name is Scholar Thorne. He sits across from me now, in Master Talmuk's private study, watching as I write these very words. He says it is important I record this moment, though he will not say why.

When he arrived this morning, he examined the ring without touching it, his eyes reflecting its glow. Then he looked at me and smiled—a surprisingly kind expression on his severe face.

"Do you sense anything unusual when near it?" he asked.

I almost lied, but something in his gaze compelled truth. "A sound like distant music," I admitted. "When I close my eyes, I almost hear words."

He nodded as if I had confirmed something. "Put on the ring, Elodin."

Master Talmuk protested, but Scholar Thorne silenced him with a gesture. "The ring has been... prepared. It will reveal what we need to know."

Hesitantly, I slipped the ring onto my finger.

The world... shifted. Not dramatically, not in ways I could easily describe. Colors seemed deeper, edges sharper. And the music—it clarified into distinct melodies, though the words remained elusive.

"What do you experience?" Scholar Thorne asked carefully.

"Everything seems more real," I struggled to explain. "And there's a... shimmer around you. Like heat above a summer road, but with purpose."

He smiled fully then, and for a moment I glimpsed something vast behind his eyes, as though the man before me was merely a doorway to something far greater.

"Silversmith Talmuk," he said, not looking away from me, "I regret to inform you that your apprentice must conclude his training with you. He is required at the Academy."

Master began to sputter about contracts and guild laws, but I barely heard him. The ring on my finger pulsed with my heartbeat, and in that rhythm, I finally understood one word in the endless music:

*Awakened*.

Scholar Thorne tells me I will leave for the Academy in three days. He says I must record my experiences before formal training begins to preserve my "unfiltered perspective." He says someday these words might help another like me.

I do not understand how a simple silversmith's apprentice could have shaped what I did. Scholar Thorne speaks in riddles, mentioning "natural gifts" and "rare intuition." Master Talmuk alternates between pride and resentment—he is losing an apprentice but gaining connections to the Academy.

My family reacted with stunned silence when I told them. Mother wept, whether from joy or fear I cannot tell. Father asked repeatedly about payment, unable to comprehend that the Academy does not charge for those they specifically select. "A blessing from the heavens," the village elder called it, though his eyes showed uncertainty.

Only my sister Nera seemed to truly understand. "You've always sensed things differently," she said, hugging me fiercely. "Remember when you told me the river rocks were humming? Father thrashed you for telling tales, but I believed you."

I had forgotten that childhood fancy. Now I wonder if the stones truly were humming, in their slow, patient way.

The ring remains with Scholar Thorne. He says he must "complete its preparation" before I can wear it again. When I sleep, I dream of a mountain filled with light, of hallways lined with knowledge that dances like flame, of voices calling me upward.

Three days until I leave everything I have known. Three days until I begin a path I never sought nor imagined possible.

I am terrified. I am exhilarated.

I am awakening.
