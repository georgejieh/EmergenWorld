# Regional Folkloric Traditions of the Western Valleys

*Collected and annotated by Professor Maren Halston, Department of Cultural Heritage, Westford Academy of Higher Learning, 392nd year of the Third Age*

## Preface

This modest collection represents six seasons of field research across the farming communities and mining settlements of the Western Valleys. The oral traditions recorded herein offer valuable insights into the everyday perspectives of our rural populations and their interpretations of natural phenomena and extraordinary encounters.

While some academic colleagues dismiss such folkloric material as mere superstition unworthy of serious study, I maintain that these cultural artifacts provide essential context for understanding regional values, communal knowledge transmission, and the practical wisdom that sustains these communities through hardship. The proverbs, songs, and tales presented here have survived generations precisely because they contain functional truths, however metaphorically expressed.

I have endeavored to record these traditions as faithfully as possible in their original form, with minimal academic interpretation, allowing the authentic voices of the Western Valleys to speak for themselves. Analytical commentary appears only in the footnotes and introduction to each section.

## I. Seasonal Proverbs and Agricultural Wisdom

The following collection of sayings regulates agricultural timing in communities where formal calendars remain uncommon. These proverbs demonstrate sophisticated observational knowledge translated into memorable, transmissible forms.

### Planting Times

> "When elderflower blooms white as snow, the time to plant your corn has come to show."

> "Plow when the oak leaf matches a mouse's ear; plant when it reaches a squirrel's."

> "Three thunders before planting brings fortune; three after brings sorrow."

> "The first rain that wets the swallow's nest marks the last frost of spring."

### Weather Prediction

> "Red sky at night, shepherd's delight; red sky at morning, shepherd's warning."

> "When the cattle gather under the old elm tree, the rain will come before you count to three."

> "Clear moon, frost soon."

> "When smoke descends, good weather ends."

> "Caterpillars with extra wool mean winter will be extra full."

### Harvest Guidelines

> "Harvest in the waning moon to keep your food from spoiling soon."

> "Count seven moons from the first cuckoo's call to when the harvest begins to fall."

> "The third fog of autumn foretells the first snow."

> "Pick on dry days, store on wet, your family's winter meals are set."

## II. The Warden of Mistwood Glen

*This tale is recounted throughout the Western Valleys with remarkable consistency, suggesting either a common origin or an extraordinary encounter witnessed by multiple parties. While dismissed by city-dwellers as mere fancy, the tale persists with such conviction among rural communities that traveling merchants routinely avoid the described locale after dusk.*

In the deepest part of Mistwood, where the sun's light barely reaches the forest floor, there stands a circle of seven white stones, each taller than a man. The elders say these stones were not placed by human hands but grew from the earth in the time before time.

It is said that a woman named Elora lived alone in a small cottage near this stone circle. She was neither young nor old, and though she spoke little, she welcomed travelers with a warm hearth and healing remedies. The villagers would seek her aid when illness struck their families or blight threatened their crops.

One harsh winter, a band of outlaws came to the nearby village. A young shepherd boy, tending his flock at the forest edge, overheard them speaking of the healer woman who lived alone in the woods and the treasures of herbs and remedies she must possess. The outlaws boasted of their plan to take her supplies by force if needed, unconcerned about the fate of a lone woman. The boy, whose younger sister had once been healed by Elora, ran through the night to warn her.

When he arrived, breathless, Elora thanked him calmly and gave him a small pouch of herbs for his mother before sending him home. "The forest remembers those who harm its own," she told him as he departed.

That night, the villagers heard the outlaws passing through, headed toward Mistwood. Shortly after, a strange mist rose suddenly from the forest floor, so thick and unnatural that it could be seen even from the village edge. Those keeping watch claim they heard distant screams throughout the night, though none dared enter the forest to investigate.

When dawn came, the mist had cleared. One man returned to the village—the leader of the outlaws, his hair now white as snow, his eyes wide with terror. Before collapsing from exhaustion, he spoke only of walking in circles for hours, of companions vanishing one by one, and of white stones that seemed to move when not directly watched. He died before the next sunrise, despite showing no visible wounds.

When brave souls finally ventured to Elora's cottage days later, they found it standing peacefully, with smoke rising from the chimney as always. Near the stone circle, they discovered six sets of empty clothes arranged in a perfect pattern, each set placed before one of the white stones.

To this day, it is said that Elora still tends to her cottage, unchanged by the passing years. Those with genuine need who approach with respect may still find healing and shelter. But those who enter Mistwood with ill intent become hopelessly lost, pursued by shifting mists and whispered voices, until they either flee the forest's boundaries or join the silent guardians of the stone circle.

Travelers in the Western Valleys are advised to leave small offerings—a ribbon, a coin, or a portion of food—at the forest's edge before entering Mistwood, especially after sunset. Those who honor the Warden of Mistwood, it is said, will find the paths clear and the journey safe.

## III. Work Songs and Rhythmic Traditions

These songs serve both cultural and practical functions, establishing work rhythms and reinforcing communal bonds. The cadence of each song typically matches the physical activity it accompanies.

### The Mill-Wheel Turn (Grinding Song)

## IV. The Tale of the Mountain Smith

*This account appears with notable variations throughout mining communities in the Western Valleys. While the figure described exhibits consistent characteristics, his name changes by locale (Kovar, Dorin, Grimmel, or simply "The Smith"). The tale is frequently invoked to explain particularly fine or unusual metalwork of ancient origin discovered in the region.*

The oldest miners tell of a smith who dwells within the heart of the Ironcrags, in a forge-chamber carved from living stone. They say he was once a man like any other, who discovered a vein of metal that gleamed with its own inner light. When he tried to work this metal with ordinary forge and hammer, it would not yield—not until he spoke to it as one would speak to a treasured friend.

The metal taught him its secrets—how fire could be too hot as well as too cold, how the hammer should sing rather than strike, how patience reveals what force conceals. As he learned these mysteries, the smith himself began to change. His skin took on the sheen of polished bronze, and his eyes glowed like embers in the dark.

Some say he ascended into the mountain itself, becoming one with stone and metal. Others claim he simply withdrew from the company of ordinary folk, pursuing a deeper understanding of his craft in solitude. But all versions agree on one thing: he continues his work to this day, crafting items of such exquisite function that they seem to anticipate their user's needs.

The surest sign of the Mountain Smith's work is that it never rusts nor breaks, and it often bears patterns that seem to shift when not directly observed. Those fortunate enough to possess such items find their labors mysteriously eased—axes that never dull, needles that thread themselves, cooking pots that heat evenly without scorching.

Miners who respect the old ways still leave small offerings at the entrances to deep shafts—usually a carefully crafted item of their own making. "A gift for a gift," they say. Those who follow this practice report fewer cave-ins and richer ore discoveries, while skeptics who mock the tradition often encounter frustrating equipment failures and exhausted veins.

Some of the eldest storytellers add that once every generation, the Mountain Smith seeks an apprentice. The signs are subtle—a young smith might find unusual ore samples outside their door at dawn, or discover their work mysteriously improved overnight. Those who acknowledge these signs and demonstrate both skill and humility may receive the ultimate invitation: a map etched on a small metal disc, showing passages that do not appear on any mining chart.

None can say how many, if any, have actually found the Mountain Smith's forge-chamber. But the tale endures because every few decades, a promising young metalworker from some village simply disappears, leaving behind only rumors of strange lights seen in the high mountain passes and the occasional masterwork item that appears in the markets years later, bearing an unmistakable style that ignites whispers of the Mountain Smith's continued influence.

## V. The Star-Touched Child

*This tale exhibits remarkable similarity across diverse communities despite significant geographic separation. The consistent elements suggest either a common cultural origin or multiple independent observations of similar phenomena. Notably, the communities with the strongest versions of this narrative tend to produce a higher-than-average number of individuals selected for specialized education at various regional academies.*

Once in a generation, it is said, a child is born during a meteor shower with a distinctive birthmark resembling a starburst pattern. These children, called "star-touched" by the village elders, exhibit unusual qualities from an early age.

They speak earlier than other children, often using words they could not possibly have learned. They display uncanny awareness of approaching weather changes and sometimes know of distant events before news arrives through conventional means. Most strikingly, animals respond to them with unusual affinity—wild birds may land on their outstretched hands, and even ill-tempered livestock grow calm in their presence.

The most comprehensive account comes from the mountain village of Oakridge, where a girl named Linna was born during the great meteor shower of the 298th year. By her third summer, she reportedly advised farmers on which fields to plant and which to leave fallow—guidance that saved many from ruin when unexpected floods came. By her seventh year, she could locate lost objects without searching and identified a contaminated well before anyone fell ill.

On her twelfth birthday, according to multiple witnesses, a stranger arrived in Oakridge—a tall figure in travel-worn robes who asked specifically for Linna. The elders claim this visitor demonstrated remarkable knowledge of their village despite never having been seen there before. After speaking privately with the child and her family, the stranger departed with Linna the following morning.

Years later, occasional letters arrived, speaking of studies at a distant academy and expanding knowledge. The village maintains these communications as treasured artifacts, though they grow increasingly difficult to comprehend over time, apparently addressing concepts beyond ordinary education.

In some versions of the tale, the star-touched child eventually returns home, bringing prosperity through innovative agricultural techniques or healing practices. In others, the child is never seen again in the flesh, though travelers with unusual aids or solutions to longstanding problems are sometimes identified as having been sent by their former neighbor.

Parents who notice the distinctive birthmark on newborns traditionally present the child to village elders for confirmation. The distinction brings both honor and anxiety to families, as they prepare for the possibility that their child may someday depart for destinations they cannot follow or comprehend.

## VI. Sayings of the Crossroads

These proverbs deal specifically with moral decision-making and interpersonal ethics, often framed as advice for travelers at literal or metaphorical crossroads.

> "The path that begins with another's tears will end with your own."

> "A shortcut in the journey is often a longcut in the soul."

> "The heaviest load on the longest road is still lighter than the burden of wrongdoing."

> "Three things never return once lost: the spent arrow, the spoken word, and the missed opportunity."

> "Better to sleep under stars with a clear conscience than under a roof with a troubled heart."

> "The wise traveler asks directions from those coming back, not those going forward."

> "When standing at the crossroads, look not at the paths but within yourself."

> "A broken promise weighs more than a mountain; a kept one lifts more than wings."

> "The poorest giver can still offer truth; the richest miser cannot afford lies."

> "If your words require the darkness to be spoken, your soul requires the light to be healed."
