## üåå Project Vision

EmergenWorld simulates an entire fantasy planet from the ground up:

1. Starting with procedurally generated terrain, weather, and resources
2. Introducing species that evolve through natural selection
3. Modeling behaviors through Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
4. Enabling sentient civilizations to emerge naturally
5. Generating authentic history and lore via large language models

When the simulation has run for thousands or millions of virtual years, users can enter this fully realized world, interacting with civilizations that evolved organically and completing quests that emerge from the needs and desires of its inhabitants.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Procedural World Generation**: Realistic terrain, climate, and resource distribution
- **Evolutionary Species Development**: Genetic traits that evolve through natural selection
- **Need-Driven Behavior**: Species act according to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
- **Emergent Civilizations**: Cultures, technologies, and societies that develop organically
- **Self-Generated History**: LLM-powered creation of lore, myths, and historical records
- **Time Acceleration**: Simulate thousands to millions of years in minutes
- **Interactive Exploration**: Enter the world via a Godot engine interface

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Status

**This project is in very early development.** Many components are still being designed and initial implementations are exploratory.
