## üåå Project Vision

EmergenWorld simulates an entire fantasy planet from the ground up:

1. Starting with procedurally generated terrain, weather, and resources
2. Introducing species that evolve through natural selection
3. Modeling behaviors through Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
4. Enabling sentient civilizations to emerge naturally
5. Generating authentic history and lore via large language models

When the simulation has run for thousands or millions of virtual years, users can enter this fully realized world, interacting with civilizations that evolved organically and completing quests that emerge from the needs and desires of its inhabitants.

## üìñ The Ancient Codex of Aethyria

![Lumanite Planetary Core](images/lore_image.jpeg)

> *From the Archives of the Grand Academy of Aethyria, Volume III of the Primordial Histories*
> 
> In the ages before memory, when the celestial bodies were yet young and the firmament still settling into its ordained patterns, the Great Forger cast into the void a world unlike others. At its heart pulsed not mere molten iron, but the sacred element *Lumanite* - the crystallized essence of creation itself.
> 
> This Lumanite, radiant and potent, lies deep beneath the crust of our world, forming veins and nodes that reach upward like the roots of an inverted tree. Where these veins touch near the surface, life flourishes with curious vigor, for all things that grow upon such blessed soil inherit a trace of the element's essence.

> The Great Forger, in his wisdom, bestowed the spark of consciousness only upon the creatures of flesh and blood. The verdant flora of our world, though nourished by Lumanite and vital to all life, remains fixed in purpose - to grow, to bear fruit, and to wither in their seasons. They are the foundation upon which conscious life depends, yet they themselves shall never know the burden of choice or the wonder of thought. Such is the natural order that sustains our world's delicate balance.
> 
> It is known among the wise that Lumanite is not distributed equally throughout our lands. Just as iron or gold may be abundant in one province yet absent in another, so too does the sacred element favor certain regions. The creatures and flora that dwell in such favored places may, through generations of consumption, accumulate tiny motes of this power within their being.
> 
> Verily, it has been observed that when celestial bodies of pure Lumanite - flung from the darkest reaches of the firmament - crash upon our lands, they create sanctuaries of extraordinary power. Yet such events are exceedingly rare, occurring perhaps once in many lifetimes.
> 
> The manipulation of Lumanite's essence - what the common folk call 'magic' or 'mana' - is a gift bestowed upon the rarest of beings. One may be born with the capacity to sense and channel these energies, yet without proper tutelage and awareness, such gifts lay dormant, much as a person born with an ear for music might never learn to play a lute if never exposed to melody.
> 
> Those who master the arts of mana manipulation are few indeed, for it requires both inherited aptitude and the attainment of the highest understanding - a state of enlightenment wherein one's consciousness expands beyond mundane concerns. This rare convergence explains why magical workings remain uncommon in our world, despite the element's presence beneath our very feet.
> 
> The most learned scholars theorize that what we call 'magic' is naught but a science beyond our comprehension, a manipulation of natural laws through means we have yet to fully understand. Where conventional knowledge fails, the mana flowing from Lumanite provides an alternative path to achievement, though one accessible to precious few.
> 
> Thus it is that our world remains one of limited enchantment - a realm where wonder exists yet does not dominate, where magical artifacts are treasured for their rarity, and where those who wield such powers may be revered as sages or feared as entities beyond mortal understanding.

## üìú The Path of Awakening: Life's Journey in Aethyria

![Consciousness Evolution](images/lore_image2.jpeg)

> *From the studies of Archmagister Elowen, compiled in the Grand Compendium of Life's Ascension*
>
> ### The Seven Spheres of Being
>
> Across the vast tapestry of Aethyria, all living creatures exist within the Seven Spheres of Being - a sacred progression through which consciousness flows like water through a stream bed, pooling in ever-deeper basins of awareness. The Ancients understood that all creatures begin in the Primal Sphere, yet only the rarest achieve Transcendence, where the boundaries between self and the mana currents dissolve.
>
> What follows are my observations from decades of study across all known realms and species of our world.
>
> ---
>
> ### First Sphere: The Primal Self
>
> All creatures of flesh and blood are born into the First Sphere, where the heartbeat of existence pulses strongest. Here, the creature knows only its most fundamental needs - to breathe, to eat, to rest, to mate. The beasts of field and forest rarely progress beyond this sphere, their consciousness bound to the wheel of seasons and the rhythm of their bodies.
>
> *"The simplest creature and the highest sage begin their journeys in the same waters - those of hunger and thirst."*  
> ‚Äî Elder Wisdom of the Silverpine Druids
>
> **Manifestations in the Mortal Realm:**
> - The lone hunter stalking prey
> - Creatures seeking shelter from the elements
> - Seasonal mating rituals
> - The establishment of territorial boundaries through scent and sound
>
> ---
>
> ### Second Sphere: The Guarded Self
>
> When the pangs of hunger no longer consume all thought, creatures begin to craft security from the chaos of the wild. It is in this Second Sphere that the first glimmers of awareness beyond the moment take root. Here, we observe the emergence of packs and simple tribes, the hoarding of resources, the building of shelters that outlast the storm.
>
> In this Sphere, the crude beginnings of exchange may be observed - the wolf that brings meat to the nursing mother, the apes that trade grooming for protection. It is not yet trade as civilized folk understand it, but the seeds are planted in fertile ground.
>
> **Manifestations in the Mortal Realm:**
> - Wolf packs with established hierarchies
> - Simple shelters built by emerging tribes
> - Seasonal food storage behaviors
> - The first sharing of tools and resources
> - Primitive defensive formations against predators
>
> Many scholars mark the transition from Second to Third Sphere as the true threshold of sentience, when a creature becomes more than beast but not yet fully awakened.
>
> ---
>
> ### Third Sphere: The Connected Self
>
> When creatures have conquered fear and want, they seek bonds beyond mere survival advantage. In the Third Sphere, communities take root like ancient trees, their branches intertwining in complex patterns of kinship and belonging.
>
> It is here we witness the birth of true language, stories told around fires that burn through the night, and the sacred rituals that bind tribe to tribe across valleys and mountain passes. The Third Sphere sees the establishment of permanent settlements - villages nestled in protective embraces of forest and hill, their inhabitants marked by shared symbols and traditions.
>
> Trade becomes a bond between peoples, caravans winding between settlements like threads weaving disparate cloths together.
>
> **Manifestations in the Mortal Realm:**
> - Permanent villages with communal spaces
> - Oral traditions and myth-telling
> - Tribal markings and totems
> - Regular gatherings of multiple family groups
> - Simple trade routes between neighboring settlements
> - Burial rituals and ancestral reverence
>
> ---
>
> ### Fourth Sphere: The Honored Self
>
> As communities grow in complexity, so too does the need for distinction within them. The Fourth Sphere brings forth leadership beyond the strongest arm, governance beyond instinct. It is the domain of chieftains and councils, of artisans whose works carry their marks, of warriors whose deeds are sung by bards.
>
> Written language emerges like a great magic, capturing thought in form that outlasts its thinker. Monuments rise from earth to sky, testaments to the growing conception that folk can create works greater than themselves, lasting beyond a single lifetime.
>
> Gold and silver, shell and bead - standards of value manifest as the web of exchange grows too complex for simple barter. Cities arise where once stood humble villages, their walls and towers declarations of permanence and power.
>
> **Manifestations in the Mortal Realm:**
> - Codified leadership structures and laws
> - Specialized craftspeople with distinctive styles
> - Currency systems and marketplaces
> - Monumental architecture and city walls
> - Written record-keeping and early literature
> - Class distinctions and hierarchies
> - Standing armies and territorial expansion
>
> ---
>
> ### Fifth Sphere: The Knowing Self
>
> When the struggles for safety and status no longer consume all energy, minds turn toward the heavens and the depths alike, seeking patterns in stars and soil. The Fifth Sphere is the realm of scholars and sages, where knowledge is systematically gathered and dispersed through formal teaching.
>
> Medicine evolves beyond herb-lore to anatomy, mathematics beyond counting to abstraction, metallurgy beyond utility to scientific principle. Philosophy emerges to question not just how the world is, but how it ought to be.
>
> For those rare souls born with mana sensitivity, it is often in this Sphere that their gift is first recognized and cultivated through apprenticeship. Most who will ever cast a spell begin their journey here, guided by masters who recognize the telltale shimmer of potential in their auras.
>
> **Manifestations in the Mortal Realm:**
> - Libraries and formal educational institutions
> - Observatories and laboratories
> - Medical academies and hospitals
> - Engineering marvels like aqueducts and bridges
> - Historical archives and museums
> - Philosophical schools and debates
> - Formalized magical academies for the gifted
>
> ---
>
> ### Sixth Sphere: The Realized Self
>
> Few beings progress naturally to the Sixth Sphere, where the self becomes both instrument and artist. Here dwell those who have mastered their chosen paths and seek expression beyond utility, creation beyond necessity, understanding beyond convention.
>
> The Sixth Sphere brings forth sublime art that moves the soul, inventions that reshape society's possibilities, and individuals who define their own purposes rather than accepting those handed down by tradition or necessity.
>
> Those with mana sensitivity who reach this Sphere may cast spells of considerable power, bending reality to their will through disciplined study and practice. For those without the inborn gift, this Sphere brings them to the threshold of comprehension, where they might begin to sense the currents of mana though they cannot yet manipulate them.
>
> **Manifestations in the Mortal Realm:**
> - Works of transcendent artistic beauty
> - Revolutionary inventions and discoveries
> - Individuals pursuing unique life purposes
> - Master enchanters and spell-crafters
> - Exploration beyond known boundaries
> - Symphonies, grand philosophies, and other works of intellectual synthesis
> - Magical artifacts of significant power
>
> ---
>
> ### Seventh Sphere: The Transcendent Self
>
> The rarest of achievements, the Seventh Sphere represents consciousness expanded beyond the boundaries of self. Those who attain this level of being perceive the world not as separate from themselves but as an extension of consciousness - the ultimate realization that all is connected through the flowing currents of mana, emanating from the Lumanite core of the world.
>
> It is only in this Sphere that those without inborn sensitivity to mana may truly wield magic, having achieved such harmony with existence that the barriers between intention and manifestation grow thin. Even those born with the gift find their powers magnified a hundredfold upon reaching Transcendence, capable of workings that lesser mages would deem impossible.
>
> The Transcendent understand that to shape reality is not to impose will upon inert matter, but to dance with forces already in motion, guiding rather than commanding. Their magic appears effortless because it works with the grain of existence rather than against it.
>
> **Manifestations in the Mortal Realm:**
> - Legendary sages who live in perfect harmony with nature
> - Archmages of unparalleled power and wisdom
> - Miraculous healers whose touch extends beyond the physical
> - Prophets who perceive the patterns of time itself
> - Creators of artifacts that defy conventional understanding
> - Beings who may manifest or vanish at will
> - Those who have attained immortality not through desperate grasping but through transcending the very concept of death
>

When interpreting historical events or analyzing emergent behaviors among observed species, scholars are advised to reference the corresponding Sphere manifestations. For practical purposes of classification and prediction, the specific thresholds between Spheres have been cataloged in the appendix "Measurable Transitions in Consciousness Evolution," available to adepts of the Eighth Circle and above.

If you encounter import errors, try one of these approaches:

1. Make sure you've installed the package in development mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. If that doesn't work, you can modify your example scripts to add the project root to the Python path:
   ```python
   import sys
   import os
   # Add project root to Python path
   sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))
   ```
